# ESP8266-Relays
This repository contains the code that I uploaded to ESP8266 Relays that I ordered off E-Bay. The relays are used to control my gate and garage motors, and to make various other electrical switches "smarter".

The code in this repository is a modified version of that written by James Eli (of which the original can be found here: https://ucexperiment.wordpress.com/2016/12/18/yunshan-esp8266-250v-15a-acdc-network-wifi-relay-module/ )

The Blynk libraries and app are used to control the relays.
